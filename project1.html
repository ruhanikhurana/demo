			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>This case study was inspired by my husband and his constant business travel. I travel with him as much as I can and experience first hand how difficult business travel can be. Planning part becomes a constant source of stress and majority of the business travellers have to rely on themselves for planning, organization and fixing their plans on the go.</p>

			<p>Outside of my personal experiences, according to statista.gov global business travel spending in 2017 reached 1.33tn USD and is on a rise for 2018. (statista.com). Millions of people travel to new countries on business each year and most of the time they do not speak the local language and have no idea how to get to the right places for their meetings on time.</p>

			<p>I found that every country had a ride-share app and I did not want to go through creating an account in every country. Every time we traveled to new country we had to figure out how to book an uber or something similar to that service. The global fragmentation of ride share apps means that there is often different apps for each country the traveller visits, all of which have long account sign-up processes.</p>

			<p>The last thing I want is to have 15 apps on my phone and use each of them, maybe once a year, for a couple of days. Keeping up with cross schedules, meetings, flights, locations for hotels and meetings is mind blowingly difficult - we need something better.</p>

			<p>So, I went and designed NeverL8 app based on my personal experience. 
			At first I had many ideas and tried to include everything but the kitchen sink. I was really excited because I was my own user and going with many of my own assumptions.</p>

			<p>I realized that not only I was designing for myself, I was also too concerned about how to monetize the app as opposed to usability.  However, I needed to focus on a problem at hand and that brought me to a human concierges idea, having an offshore personal organizer team to help with calendar, estimated travel time between locations, booking car services for a client, monitoring their location, and notifying participants of upcoming meeting if the user is running behind schedule.</p>

			<p>I went out and talked to business travelers and gathered information.</p>

			<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
			<p>I interviewed some people, most of them book travel themselves and they gave me feedback about the way they do it, the way they use calendars or book their travel. After various interviews and user testing I came to the conclusion that NeverL8 app would be most useful for people who are significantly busy and have back to back meetings, whether overseas or at home.</p>

			<h2>Goals</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>To create an effective, efficient, and satisfying user interface design for a busy international business traveller.</li>
				<li>Understand business goals and constraints from a stakeholder perspective;</li>
				<li>Conduct user research to validate target users and further understand the existing problems, motivations and needs of those users;</li>
				<li>Use an iterative design process to create and test interface solutions for the discovered needs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Our target user leads sales and business dev for a fortune 500 company. He/she travels 3 out of 4 weeks in the month, and when this user travels, it’s almost always internationally. Between all of the travel to different time zones and a busy meeting schedule in different cities, the user finds it challenging to keep up with his/her calendar to show up to the right places at the right time.</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Design an interface that is smart enough to suggest meeting times, accounts for changing time zones, and is proactively working for my user to make sure he/she is always on time for his/her meetings.</p>


			<h4>Taking it to the next level</h4>
			<p>To really take it to the next step I would need to run some Google ads that pitch the services and would have sign-up forms for the limited Beta. This would be a best way to test out the market hypothesis whether random users would be willing to pay for the services. </p>
