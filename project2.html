			<h2 class="primary-bodytext">My Journey into UX</h2>

			<p>I have spent 5 years as a Commercial Photographer in both the Corporate and Fashion arenas. I have strong empathy and relationships with my clients and partners. I enjoy bringing new ideas and insights to them in the work that I do. I enjoy stories and puzzles, and began moving into UX because of it’s greater creative opportunities in these areas vs ‘static moment’ in time as a photographer. In UX I get to combine my love for design, skills of storytelling with the puzzle of how a user experience should be architected and fit together. Needless to say - Photography is still one of my greatest passions.</p>

			<p>Just like in photography, in UX you need to understand your user, your audience and you always work with a stakeholder (someone who has the ultimate vision).</p>

			<p>Technology is getting better and many people own decent cameras these days. Even new iphones are able to produce a great image.</p>

			<p>With UX it is  easier to determine whether or not the user experience is good or bad. With photography most of the people don’t know what the quality image looks like. They only know whether they like themselves in the picture or not.</p>

			<p>One of the Key things I learned in Fashion Photography is storytelling and problem solving. Sometimes equipment does not work, or light is not strobing, sometimes the model is having a bad day or the team is not fully prepared. My job has always been to make solve the technical problems while managing creative team of Hair and Make-up, Styling, make models comfortable. And tell the story through one image or the selection of images.</p>
