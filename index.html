			<h2>A little about me</h2>

			<p>My name is Maryna Marston and I am an aspiring UX/UI Designer and an award winning photographer based in Austin. 

			I was born in Ukraine into a greek-polish-ukrainian family, I am a Brit and I live in America. I speak 3 languages fluently and play piano.</p>

			<p>I worked on numerous projects, winning several prestigious certificates of excellence awards, judges choice ribbons, distinguished print awards and trophies in photography industry. I am excited to start this new chapter of my life with UX!</p>

			<p>I have fallen into UX becuase of it's creative side and thoughtful processes.

			I like to experiment with what I am given and enjoy the process of creativity.</p>

			<p>I am an avid traveller! I love visiting new countries, I like some extreme sports, I would taste alsmost everything, but coffee is most definately my drug of choice! If I am not in Austin, you can find me kyaking in Vietnam, diving off the Great Barrier Reef or hiking somewhere in Costa Rica. 
			Life is a gift and I intend to enjoy it!</p>
